Hey if you dont know how to install this heres how:
1. navigate to "C:\(username here)\Documents|Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures"
2. put the folder SUKE01 into the folder root
3. Enjoy!
this works at native resolution, but looks bitcrushed as hek so please in dolphin go to graphics options => Advanced and change the output resolution from "Native (640x528)" to either 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, or 8x Native to see it in full detail depending on your hardware
